                <p>The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase different skills that I have cultivated during this course. Through HTML Coding and many tears, I present the summation of my work. Through image editing to create represent key ideas from a book, to video production to be able to create quality educational content, I have been able to leave my comfort zone and develop new skills.</p>

					<h2>Image Editing</h2>
					<p>In project 1 I used image editing software to put together two images along with text to visually provide details about the book Dune. In this project I altered the two images in a way that made them go together to create one new image.</p>

					<h2>Web Design</h2>
					<p>Projects 2 and 3 resulted in the creation of working websites after I altered HTML, Javascript, and CSS codes. Using the web hosting platform GitHub, I was able to use the files I created to make new webpages with the changes I made.</p>

					<h2>Video Production</h2>
					<p>In project 5 I created an educational video on how to take care of a cat. The audience this video was created for is younger children, as I am a kindergarten teacher. Using iMovie for Mac, I edited the video together, used transitions, and narrations. </p>
