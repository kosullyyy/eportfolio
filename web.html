               <center> <p>Using HTML Javascript to create web pages I created a drag and drop quiz and a general knowledge quiz. HTML editing has been what I struggled with the most, as well as where I feel like I have had the most personal growth. Before this class I had 0 knowledge about how to edit these kinds of codes.

<center> For the drag-n-drop quiz I first edited the HTML by changing the shuffle feature to true, the section titles to reflect my own content, and altered the answer choice options, as well as added options. For the CSS file I changed the background color, changed the list title color, and the size of the white background, and finally changed the size of the gray box around the answer choices.

</div></div><center>For the General knowledge quiz I created I first made changed to the HTML file by changing the title to "Trivia Quiz." Next, I used google to select a light purple color, B984d9, and changed the background color. I added breaks between the solution and your response lines using <  br   > to finish up the HTML changes. For the Java Script file I changed the number of questions to 10 andI changed all the existing questions to general trivia questions. I copy and pasted one of the questions to create 6-10, and then changed the content inside to have them reflect what I wanted and changed the answer choice numbers and options to reflect the new questions.
